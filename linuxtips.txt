[system commands]
uname -a : check linux version, including kernel etc.

[packages]
1. apt search keyword - search a package online without install
   apt search .   - search all packages online
   apt search --names-only keyword - search the package names with keyword
   apt search ^keyword$ - search the exactly word
  Note: if you can't find any package, you need run "apt-get update" first to establish the packages cache
2. apt list --installed : list all installed packages in system
   apt list --installed | grep python: check if python is installed in system
   dpkg --get-selections | grep python : check if the package is installed in system
   dpkg -l | grep python : check if the package is installed in system [simple version]
3. which <command> : local a command in system
4. ls --color-always | less -R : less with color. most commands support --color=always
   unbuffer apt list | less -R : list specified package using less with color, you need to install "expect" first
	  suo apt install expect : install command "unbuffer"

[misc. commands]
1. Getting the default command line text editor used in system
	$ sudo update-alternatives --config editor : change the default command line editor
	$ update-alternatives --query editor
	$ echo $EDITOR  - NOT working

[files, directory]
A file type helps us in identifying the type of content that is saved in the file. Linux supports six different types of files.
The different types of names of files present are :
- Regular file: Regular or ordinary files store data of various content types such as text,
	audio, video, images, scripts, and programs. In Linux, regular files can be created with or without an extension.
- Directory file: File systems use directories to organize files in a hierarchy. Directories are
	also files, but instead of storing data, they store the location of other files. Each directory entry stores the name and location of a single file.
- Link file: Link files allow us to use a file with a different filename and from a different location.
	For this, we use link files. A link file is a pointer to another file. There are two types of links: a hard link and a symbolic or soft link.
- Special file: Linux treats all hardware devices (such as hard drives, printers, monitors, terminal emulators, and CD/DVD drives) as special files.
	Linux places all special files or device files under the /dev directory. There are two types of special files: a character special file and a block special file.
- Socket file: A socket is a communication endpoint that applications use to exchange data. Each application that provides services
	to other applications or remote clients uses a socket to accept connections. Each socket has an associated IP address and port number that allow it to accept connections from clients.
- Named pipe file: Named pipe files are empty pipe files. The kernel processes named pipe files without writing them to the file system.
	Named pipe files can exist anywhere in the file system. They are also called the FIFO (First In First Out) files.

How To Create A File In Linux:
$ touch <filename>
$ cat > <filename>
$ echo "message" > <filename>
$ printf

Indentify the type of a file:
$ file <filename>

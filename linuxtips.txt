1. apt search keyword - search a package online without install
   apt search .   - search all packages online
   apt search --names-only keyword - search the package names with keyword
   apt search ^keyword$ - search the exactly word
  Note: if you can't find any package, you need run "apt-get update" first to establish the packages cache
2. apt list --installed : list all installed packages in system
   apt list --installed | grep python: check if python is installed in system
   dpkg --get-selections | grep python : check if the package is installed in system

You can get the list of installed files with:
   apt-file list package-name
   dpkg -L package-name
3. which <command> : local a command in system
4. ls --color-always | less -R : less with color. most commands support --color=always
   unbuffer apt list | less -R : list specified package using less with color, you need to install "expect" first
	  suo apt install expect : install command "unbuffer"

[misc. commands]
1. Getting the default command line text editor used in system
	$ sudo update-alternatives --config editor : change the default command line editor
	$ update-alternatives --query editor

[files, directory]
A file type helps us in identifying the type of content that is saved in the file. Linux supports six different types of files.
The different types of names of files present are :
- Regular file: Regular or ordinary files store data of various content types such as text,
	audio, video, images, scripts, and programs. In Linux, regular files can be created with or without an extension.
- Directory file: File systems use directories to organize files in a hierarchy. Directories are
	also files, but instead of storing data, they store the location of other files. Each directory entry stores the name and location of a single file.
- Link file: Link files allow us to use a file with a different filename and from a different location.
	For this, we use link files. A link file is a pointer to another file. There are two types of links: a hard link and a symbolic or soft link.
- Special file: Linux treats all hardware devices (such as hard drives, printers, monitors, terminal emulators, and CD/DVD drives) as special files.
	Linux places all special files or device files under the /dev directory. There are two types of special files: a character special file and a block special file.
- Socket file: A socket is a communication endpoint that applications use to exchange data. Each application that provides services
	to other applications or remote clients uses a socket to accept connections. Each socket has an associated IP address and port number that allow it to accept connections from clients.
- Named pipe file: Named pipe files are empty pipe files. The kernel processes named pipe files without writing them to the file system.
	Named pipe files can exist anywhere in the file system. They are also called the FIFO (First In First Out) files.

How To Create A File In Linux:
$ touch <filename>
$ cat > <filename>
$ echo "message" > <filename>
$ printf

Indentify the type of a file:
$ file <filename>

[find/search]
search for files and directories in specified path based on differen criteria.
find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-Olevel] [-D debugopts] [path...] [expression]
$find . -type f \( -name '*.jpg' -or -name '*.png' \)   - find files with several patterns, case sensitive
$find . -type f --iname *.pl  - find file name case insensitive with pattern
$find . -type (f: files, d: directories, l: symbol links)

grep: print lines that match patterns IN FILES. A FILE of “-” stands for standard input. 
grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
       grep [OPTION]... -e PATTERNS ... [FILE]...
       grep [OPTION]... -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE]...
grep searches for patterns in each FILE.

fd-find: is replacement of find, more faster, also can replace grep for finding content in files
 fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] [<pattern>] [<path>...]
 fzf: a fuzzer finder, interactive search
fd  -t, --type <filetype>...
            Filter the search by type:
              'f' or 'file':         regular files
              'd' or 'directory':    directories
              'l' or 'symlink':      symbolic links
              's' or 'socket':       socket
              'p' or 'pipe':         named pipe (FIFO)

              'x' or 'executable':   executables
              'e' or 'empty':        empty files or directories
$fd .c .  - search all C files in current directory recursively

reggrep to replace grep. ripgrep (rg) recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.
    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] -e PATTERN ... [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] -f PATTERNFILE ... [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list
-t, --type <TYPE>... : search only types
-e, --regexp <PATTERN>...  : search with pattern
-s, --case-sensitive
$ rg -e -foo: search recursively in the current directory for "-foo"

[disk size, file size]
$ du -sh */   - show size of all directories in the current directory
$ du -sch .[!.]* *   - show all directories including hidden of the current diretory with total sizes
$ du -sch .[!.]* * | sort -h  - sort the result as well 
$ du -h -d 2 */   - show size of directories 2 depth relative to the current directory
$ df -h       - show disk size usage

[process, jobs]
$jobs -l %n  - show job number n (without n, show all jobs)
$fg %n - move job to foreground and activate
$bg %n - move job to background and activate
$kill %n - kill job
$disown %n - clean up job
to run a command in background and no prompt (redirect stdout/stderr to
/dev/null:
$ command > /dev/null 2>&1 &

NOTE: when using job ID, you put "%n", when PID, just the number

[compress, decompress, zip/unzip]
https://www.7-zip.org/
Common Compression Formats:
.zip - ideal for everyday file compression tasks, such as combining files for
       convenient sharing or email attachments. Popular for each OS.
.iso - utilized extensively for software and game distribution.
.rar - Known for achieving high compression ratios, RAR files are common in archiving large file collections or creating split archives.
.tar - AR is used to gather multiple files into a single archive without compression.
       It is often combined with compression methods like GZIP or BZIP2, resulting in formats like .tar.gz or .tar.bz2.
.7z - is recognized for its strong compression capabilities and is often chosen when high efficiency is required.
       It allows large files to be compressed significantly and supports encryption.
.gz - Commonly used to compress web content for more efficient delivery,
      GZIP reduces the size of web pages and scripts to improve load times.
      It is often paired with TAR to compress multiple files in Unix-like systems.
      Works on single file, NOT directory.

- preinstalled tools in Debian system:
gzip[.gz]: GNU zip, compress or uncompress files. Works with only single files(NOT directory),
      ie, each file will be compressed into a separate .gz file if many files.
      Compress or uncompress FILEs (by default, compress FILES in-place).
      gunzip: Uncompress FILEs (by default, in-place).
      Best situable for compressing large single files.
      eg:
      gzip -d -S .pack Renesas.FSP.pack  - decompress the file with suffix ".pack" which is actually compressed in .zip.
      tar -zcvf output_file_name directory_to_compress - compress(create -c) a directory in place using gzip (-z)
      tar -xvf output_file_name -C directory_to_compress - extract(create -x) a directory in place using gzip (-z)
bzip2/bunzip2: a block-sorting file compressor.
tar: GNU 'tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can restore individual files from the archive.
    Main operation mode:
  -c, --create               create a new archive
  -t, --list                 list the contents of an archive
  -x, --extract, --get       extract files from an archive
   options:
  -C, --directory=DIR        change to directory DIR
  -f, --file=ARCHIVE         use archive file or device ARCHIVE
    Compression options:
  -a, --auto-compress        use archive suffix to determine the compression program
  -I, --use-compress-program=PROG filter through PROG (must accept -d)
  -j, --bzip2                filter the archive through bzip2
  -J, --xz                   filter the archive through xz
      --lzip                 filter the archive through lzip
      --lzma                 filter the archive through xz
      --lzop                 filter the archive through lzop
      --no-auto-compress     do not use archive suffix to determine the compression program
      --zstd                 filter the archive through zstd
  -z, --gzip, --gunzip, --ungzip   filter the archive through gzip (.gz)
  -Z, --compress, --uncompress   filter the archive through compress
Use gzip or bzip2 for single files and tar for directories. Popular in Linux.

zip[.zip]: compress different files into one single .zip file. 
unzip [-Z] [-opts[modifiers]] file[.zip] [list] [-x xlist] [-d exdir]
      unzip: Default action is to extract files in list, except those in xlist, to exdir
      Best situable for compressing multiple small files and security.
      eg:
      unzip -q source_file_list -d target_directory
